## Running Examples

All examples consist of main configuration file `config.go`. Running this file using `go run config.go` will result in invoking the generators and you will see the code that was generated in the current working directory.

> To not pollute your tree with generated files, either set the output directory to different for every generator, or use other working directory and invoke the script from there
